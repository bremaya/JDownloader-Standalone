# JDownloader Standalone

JDownloader is a free, open-source download management tool with a huge community that makes downloading as easy and fast as it should be. Users can start, stop or pause downloads, set bandwith limitations, auto-extract archives and much more. It's an easy-to-extend framework that can save hours of your valuable time every day!


This is a personal project, and I'm not related with JDownloader Team (https://jdownloader.org/), Appwork GmbH (https://jdownloader.org/impressum), Oracle Java (https://www.java.com/) or PortableApps (https://portableapps.com).
Only unpack and enjoy (unpack in PortableApps folder to integrate with him).

This is packed with JDownloader v2.0 build 45958 and Java v1.8.0 Update 333.
